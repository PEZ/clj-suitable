# Suitable - reddit: An addon for Figwheel and Emacs Cider to aid live exploratory development in ClojureScript

This project is a backend for interactive repls and editors that provide
completion / intellisense support.

It is mainly useful for cljs / js interop as it tries to access the properties
and methods of objects at runtime via reflection to generate completion
candidates out of them. This can be extremely useful and productive if you're
experimenting around with unknown APIs.
